I am a Masters student in Data Science at Indiana University Bloomington. Though my degree is in Data Science, I am more interested in AI research and have plans of pursuing my PhD in Machine Learning. But before that I want to gain the relevant industry experience and explore the field further. Therefore, I am looking for full time opportunities in Machine Learning and Deep Learning or Reinforcement Learning. Previously, I have worked as Research Assistant under Prof. Roni Khardon where I worked on developing Bayesian Frameworks for detecting Transcription Start Sites in plants. That was an invaluable experience for me and I got to learn how we can leverage the power of ML to solve some of the most challenging problems in science.
